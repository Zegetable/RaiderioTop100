# RaiderioTop100
Scrapes player data for top players 100 from various categories
current order is: top 100 overall, top 100 role, top 100 for each spec

Running:
1) currently run via command prompt standard python execution
2) tested with generic localhost MySQL
3) make sure to replace MySQL info at top of SeleniumSQL file before running

Things to look into:
1) could condense some code by making next page navigation into a function
2) could fill spec name array while navigating the specs to make code look cleaner, but nbd
3) Concurrency could be looked into because the program takes awhile to execute currently. However, there would be issues with becoming locked due to ddos protection if requesting too frequently.
